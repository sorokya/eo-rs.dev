I set up this site to act as both a development blog
and a source of tutorials, and documentation for all
of the eo.rs projects.

The main focus at the moment is getting [reoserv](/docs/projects/reoserv/)
up to feature parity with the [eoserv](https://eoserv.net/) project.

I'm also developing up the [eo](/docs/projects/eo/) create as I go!

I have a few ideas for blogs already from the [reoserv](/docs/projects/reoserv/)
project. Stay tuned!
